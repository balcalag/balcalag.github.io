  <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Bertah1>
  <p> I am currently studying A levels in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics, but I still love history, mythology, philosphy, literature. 
      Revising for my exams can be daunting at times and not pleasurable at all, which feels weird because I'm supposed to love these subjects. I think is because the A-level curriculum doesn't really branch out. 
      This sounds cliche, I know, but ever since I was little I've been writing sotries, drawing comics, making programs, reading everything that caught my eye. So, I decided to strat this site as a space to really explore the things I'm interesteed in; I'm always reading books, watching documentariaes, listening to lectures and podcarsts-so why not unleash my creativity here?
      This site won't be just about my school subjects; it'll be a mic of niche interests and ideas I'm passionate about.</p>
